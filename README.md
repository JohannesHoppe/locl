üåê **Locl is an internationalization (i18n) tools suite for Angular.**

### Demos
You can find a complete demo in the [apps/demo folder](apps/demo) and another one simpler [on StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/ivy-ovy4cd) (it can take a long time to load the first time because ivy support on StackBlitz is still WIP).

### Core
A library with various utility functions to help you with \$localize.

- [Documentation](libs/core)

### CLI
Dev tools to help you with `$localize` and Angular i18n.

- [Documentation](libs/cli)

### Roadmap
We have a bunch of features planned on our roadmap, but you can see the features requested by the community and vote for the ones that you want the most on https://locl.hellonext.co/.

### License

Locl tools and libraries are distributed under the [AGPL v3.0 license](<https://tldrlegal.com/license/gnu-affero-general-public-license-v3-(agpl-3.0)>).
You can use them for free in open source projects, but if you want to use them in commercial products with close source you are required to buy a proprietary license (coming soon).
